# Rovi-II

Rovi-I was a Make:it Robotics starter kit, running a different code, plus a PING))) sensor (From Parallax).  Code is here: https://github.com/coreyreichle/arduino under "robot".

Rovi-II will be Gen 2 of Rovi-I. It will be equipped with an entire sensor array to detect it's surroundings (HC-SRO4 for proximity, PIR for movement detection, Gyro sensor for real movement tracking, and a light detection array).

Rovi-II will also be using a NiCAD power cell, with solar charging circuit.  A Beaglebone Black board will be providing the higher level functions (Telemetry, SLAM, etc), and an Arduino will be providing lower level functions (Motor control, sensor management, etc etc).
